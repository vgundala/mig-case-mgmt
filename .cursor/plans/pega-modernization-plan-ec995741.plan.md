# Lead Management System Modernization - Project Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the completed modernization project, transforming a legacy J2EE EJB/Struts application into a modern Spring Boot REST API with Pega workflow integration. The project was completed in four sequential steps, each building upon the previous work.

## Project Objectives

1. Generate Pega Blueprint documentation for workflow implementation
2. Build a Spring Boot microservice for data access and business logic
3. Create comprehensive API documentation for Pega integration
4. Implement complete testing suite for quality assurance

## Deliverable

Create a comprehensive project summary document (`PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`) in the `casemanagement-api` directory that documents all four completed implementation steps with detailed artifacts, features, and outcomes.

## Implementation

### 1. Create PROJECT_PROGRESS.md

- `lead_management_pega_process.bpmn` - Comprehensive BPMN 2.0 diagram with 3 swim lanes (Sales Person, Sales Manager, System)
- `pega_oracle_ddl.sql` - Enhanced Oracle DDL with Pega integration columns, indexes, views, and triggers
- `PEGA_BLUEPRINT_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide with personas, data model mapping, business rules, workflows, and UI components

**Key Features**:

- Visual business process representation for Pega workflow design
- Optimized database schema with performance indexes

#### Step 2: Spring Boot Microservice Implementation (COMPLETED)

**Location**: `casemanagement-api/lead-management-service/`

**Artifacts Created**:

- Complete Spring Boot 3.2 microservice with JWT authentication
- JPA entities: User, Lead, LeadHistory with audit fields
- Spring Data JPA repositories
- Service layer: LeadService, UserService, LeadScoringService, LeadDistributionService, WorkflowService
- REST controllers: AuthController, LeadController, LeadHistoryController
- DTOs for all API requests/responses
- Security configuration with JWT-based authentication
- Global exception handling
- OpenAPI configuration with Swagger UI
- Caffeine caching layer
- HikariCP connection pooling

**Technology Stack**:

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.2.x
- Spring Security with JWT (JJWT)
- Spring Data JPA with Oracle
- Caffeine Cache
- SpringDoc OpenAPI

**Key Features**:

- Complete CRUD operations for Users, Leads, LeadHistory
- Business logic: Lead scoring, round-robin distribution, workflow management
- Role-based authorization (SALES_PERSON, SALES_MANAGER)
- JWT token authentication with 24-hour expiration
- BCrypt password hashing
- Comprehensive error handling
- API documentation at `/swagger-ui.html`

#### Step 3: API Documentation (COMPLETED)

**Location**: `casemanagement-api/documentation/`

**Artifacts Created**:

- `openapi.yaml` - Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification with all endpoints
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- `SECURITY.md` - Security implementation details (JWT, authentication, authorization)
- `PEGA_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Guide for Pega developers to integrate with the microservice
- `HOW_TO_USE_LEAD_MANAGEMENT.md` - User-friendly guide for non-technical users

**API Coverage**:

- Authentication endpoints (login, register)
- Lead management endpoints (CRUD, status updates, scoring, distribution)
- Lead history endpoints (comments, audit trail)
- Workflow endpoints (escalation, approval, rejection)
- All endpoints documented with request/response examples

**Security Documentation**:

- JWT token format and lifecycle
- Authentication flow
- Authorization rules
- Password hashing with BCrypt
- Error responses and status codes

#### Step 4: Comprehensive Testing Implementation (COMPLETED)

**Location**: `casemanagement-api/lead-management-service/src/test/`

**Artifacts Created**:

**Unit Tests**:

- `LeadScoringServiceTest.java` - 15+ test scenarios for lead scoring algorithm
- `UserServiceTest.java` - 20+ test scenarios for user management and authentication
- `LeadServiceTest.java` - 18+ test scenarios for lead CRUD and business logic
- `AuthControllerTest.java` - Authentication endpoint tests with mock dependencies
- `LeadControllerTest.java` - Lead management endpoint tests with role-based access

**Integration Tests**:

- `LeadManagementServiceIntegrationTest.java` - End-to-end workflow tests
- Complete lead workflow (create → update → comment → status change)
- Authentication flow (login → access protected resources)
- Error handling (404, 401, 400 scenarios)
- Pagination and filtering with large datasets

**API Testing Scripts**:

- `Lead_Management_API_Tests.postman_collection.json` - 25+ Postman test scenarios
- Authentication tests (login, register, invalid credentials)
- Lead management tests (CRUD, status updates)
- Lead history tests (comments, audit trail)
- Workflow operations (escalation, approval, rejection)
- Error handling tests (all HTTP status codes)

**Performance Testing**:

- `load-test.sh` - Bash script for load testing with Apache Bench/curl
- `LeadManagementLoadTest.jmx` - JMeter test plan
- Concurrent users: 10, 50, 100, 500
- Request rate testing
- Response time analysis
- Throughput metrics

**Test Configuration**:

- `application-test.yml` - H2 in-memory database configuration
